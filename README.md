BalanZ - an HTML/CSS/JS puzzle game 

Made during a few holiday nights for the GameDevJS Jam 2025 on theme "Balance".

Rules
-----

Restore the balance the board by moving the cubes on it.

Click on a cube to move it to an adjacent square. 

The larger the cube, the higher the weight. 

Don't unbalance too much the board, or you'll lose.

Solve the levels in a minimal number of moves.
